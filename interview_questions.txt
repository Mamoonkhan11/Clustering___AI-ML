1️. How does K-Means clustering work?
It groups data into K clusters by minimizing the distance between points and their nearest cluster centroids.

2️. What is the Elbow method?
It helps find the optimal number of clusters (K) by plotting inertia vs K and choosing the point where inertia reduction slows down.

3️. What are the limitations of K-Means?
It’s sensitive to outliers, assumes spherical clusters, and struggles with categorical data.

4️. How does initialization affect results?
Poor centroid initialization can lead to wrong or unstable clusters; using k-means++ improves this.

5️. What is inertia in K-Means?
It’s the sum of squared distances between each point and its assigned cluster centroid.

6️. What is Silhouette Score?
It measures how well-separated and cohesive clusters are; higher values mean better-defined clusters.

7️. How do you choose the right number of clusters?
Use the Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, or Gap Statistic to determine optimal K.

8️. What’s the difference between clustering and classification?
Clustering is unsupervised (no labels), while classification is supervised (uses labeled data).
